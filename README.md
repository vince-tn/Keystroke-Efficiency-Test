**How It Works**

    Select a difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

    You’ll be given an editable code snippet and a target snippet.

    Use keyboard shortcuts and efficient editing to transform the editable code into the target.

    Your keystrokes are counted. Closer to the optimal number = higher score.
